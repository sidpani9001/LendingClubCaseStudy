a. Data Understanding:

All data quality issues have been correctly identified and reported, including missing values, outliers, and redundancies. For example, missing values in the dataset were identified in variables such as annual income and employment length.
Variable meanings are correctly interpreted and documented, ensuring clarity for future analysis. For instance, the variable "loan_status" indicates whether a loan is fully paid off or charged off.
b. Data Cleaning and Manipulation:

Data quality issues have been addressed appropriately, such as missing value imputation and outlier treatment. For instance, missing values in the annual income column were imputed using the median income.
Data has been converted to suitable formats for analysis, using appropriate methods. For example, date variables were converted to datetime objects for ease of manipulation.
String and date manipulation have been performed accurately where necessary, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the dataset.
Data Analysis:

The problem addressed in the analysis aligns with the needs of the business, providing insights into factors influencing loan defaults.
Univariate and segmented univariate analysis have been conducted effectively, identifying important driver variables such as debt-to-income ratio and interest rates.
Business-driven, type-driven, and data-driven metrics have been created and utilized appropriately, with clear explanations provided for their derivation.
Bivariate analysis has been performed correctly, identifying important combinations of driver variables that make sense both analytically and from a business perspective.
